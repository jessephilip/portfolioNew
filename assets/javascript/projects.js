This was one of my first homework assignments with the UT Coding Bootcamp, and I did my best to make this assignment my own. I imbued it with my sense of humor and tried to achieve a retro style. I went above the parameters of the assignment to "paint" my own graphics with Microsoft Paint. There are also YouTube videos scattered about, a scoring system, and three difficulty settings. To this day, this is one of my favorite websites, and if you permit me to say so, I actually find it quite entertaining.'

This was a group project in which I was involved in its concept and implementation. I worked on both the user experience and backend code, having to edit HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I am particularly proud of my code that set up the Google "One Click" Sign-In experience. I consider this product to be in its Alpha production and have many plans for further improving it in the future.'

In reality, it does so much more. Utilizing Firebase.auth() and Google Sign-In, players can join games and see the progress of the game no matter where they are. \r I plan to provide additional tools such as storyboarding, deck building, and custom point systems.	MTG the Console is, at heart, my training tool, therefore it has seen many iterations and rewrites as my knowledge of programming has progressed. The original MTG the Console was actually an Android app written in Java and XML using Android Studio. During my education with the UT Coding Bootcamp, it transformed into a simple HTML site with limited Javascript, to using an SQL database, to the current version which utilizes Firebase for authentication and databasing. I plan to put it back on the phone by reworking it for React-Native.'

Utilizing HTML5\'s geolocation, Ranger determines where the user is currently located and provides the user with the weather, a weather forecast, and nearby trails and parks. Ranger also sports a small social-networking feature that allows users to update photographs of parks they have visited. Ranger was my first group project with the UT Coding Bootcamp. I was involved in the conception, design, and implementation of the website. I helped the team write up the HTML and CSS, but I mainly worked in the Javascript for this project. I am most proud of my code that used the Open Trails API to populate the Google map with individual map markers. \n When I get the time, I plan to revisit Ranger and detach it from the Open Trails API, so that it becomes a strictly Google Places website.'

And that I can multi-task (so make that two purposes). Coding Bootcamps are time-consuming, strenuous, races to fill a student\'s head with as much knowledge and experience within a short period of time. I was in school full time and studying full time. And in the heart of that, I was planning and preparing a wedding! (as well as juggling my own side projects. We also adopted another dog!).	Please be impressed. I worked hard to do so, and it would make the Mrs. happy.'
